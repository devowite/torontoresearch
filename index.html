    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals & Slate Blue -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as an interactive dashboard, moving away from the linear report format. The core structure features: 1) A main navigation bar with key themes that act as filters. 2) A dynamic bar chart visualizing the prevalence of these themes across the prospect list. 3) An interactive grid of company cards. This dashboard approach was chosen because it allows users (ScreenCloud sales/marketing) to quickly explore and cross-reference information. Users can filter by a theme (e.g., "Frontline Worker Connectivity") to instantly see all relevant companies and their specific initiatives, making it highly efficient for preparing for targeted conversations. The user flow is designed for exploration: see a high-level trend in the chart, filter by that trend, and then drill down into specific company details. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Frequency of key themes across all companies. -> Goal: Show which themes are most dominant. -> Viz/Presentation: Interactive Bar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas). -> Interaction: Clicking a bar on the chart filters the company grid below. -> Justification: Provides a quick, high-level overview of the market landscape and serves as the primary navigation/filtering tool.
        - Report Info: Individual company initiatives and supporting evidence. -> Goal: Provide specific, actionable insights for each prospect. -> Viz/Presentation: Interactive Company Cards (HTML/CSS/Tailwind). -> Interaction: Cards are filtered by the theme selector or chart clicks. They have visible tags and reveal more details on hover/click. -> Justification: Organizes detailed information into digestible chunks and makes it easily searchable and filterable.
        - Report Info: The four main thematic convergences. -> Goal: Group complex information logically. -> Viz/Presentation: Theme filter buttons (HTML/CSS/Tailwind). -> Interaction: Buttons control both the chart highlight and the company card grid. -> Justification: Creates a clear, task-oriented navigation structure that aligns with the report's core findings.
